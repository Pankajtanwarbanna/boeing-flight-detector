# Boeing Flight Detector üõ©Ô∏è

A browser extension that spots Boeing aircraft on flight booking sites and slaps a big red warning on them.

## Why This Exists?

Boeing's been making headlines for all the wrong reasons lately. Door plugs flying off mid-flight, crashes, investigations, whistleblowers... the list goes on. 

Yet when you're booking flights, airlines conveniently hide what aircraft you're actually flying on. This extension fixes that bullsh*t.

Now you'll see a bright red "‚ö†Ô∏è BOEING DETECTED" label on every Boeing flight. Book it or skip it - your call. At least you'll know what you're getting into.

## What It Does

- Scans flight results on Cleartrip
- Identifies all Boeing aircraft (737 MAX, 787, 777, etc.)
- Slaps a red warning label on Boeing flights
- Works in real-time as you search
- Doesn't block booking - just gives you the heads up

## Supported Sites

- ‚úÖ Cleartrip.com
- üîÑ More sites coming soon
